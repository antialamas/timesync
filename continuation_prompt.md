# Quantum Channel Simulation Project Status

## Original Task Description
Create a quantum channel simulation software that models the behavior of quantum key distribution systems. The software should simulate photon transmission through an optical channel, accounting for factors like signal/decoy states, channel loss, dark counts, and timing synchronization. It should provide visualization of the cross-correlation analysis and photon count distributions.

## Current Status
- Core simulation components are implemented in Python (quantum_channel.py)
- Visualization using Matplotlib is working (generate_plots.py)
- Basic command-line interface created (main.py)
- Web interface components have been removed to simplify the architecture
- Testing strategy documentation is in progress

## Continuation Prompt
I have a quantum channel simulation project for modeling quantum key distribution systems. The core simulation (quantum_channel.py) and visualization (generate_plots.py) components are implemented, and there's a basic command-line interface (main.py). The simulation handles signal/decoy states, channel loss, dark counts, and timing synchronization.

Please help enhance this project by:
1. Reviewing and improving the command-line interface for parameter input
2. Adding comprehensive error handling and input validation
3. Implementing data export functionality for analysis
4. Completing the testing strategy documentation

The goal is to make the software robust and user-friendly while maintaining its focus on accurate quantum channel simulation.
