## Original Prompt
"In the main.py function there is a call to simulator.generate_state(config). What does this do?"

## Sources
- src/main.py
- src/simulation/quantum_channel.py

## Function Description

The `simulator.generate_states(config)` method in the quantum channel simulator is a critical component of the decoy-state quantum key distribution protocol. This function generates the initial quantum states that Alice sends through the quantum channel.

### Configuration Parameters

The function accepts a configuration object with the following key parameters:

- `signal_power` (mu1): Mean photon number for signal states
- `decoy_power` (mu2): Mean photon number for decoy states 
- `signal_prob` (p1): Probability of sending a signal state
- `block_size`: Number of states to generate

### Return Values

The function returns two numpy arrays:

1. **States Array**: Contains randomly chosen photon numbers (either signal_power or decoy_power) based on the configured probabilities
2. **Intensity Array**: A binary array marking which pulses are signal states (1) vs decoy states (0), used later for correlation analysis

### Implementation Details

The function uses numpy's random.choice to generate states according to the configured probabilities:

```python
states = np.random.choice(
    [config.signal_power, config.decoy_power],
    p=[config.signal_prob, 1 - config.signal_prob],
    size=int(config.block_size)
)

intensity = (states == config.signal_power).astype(int)
```

### Protocol Context

This function implements a key part of the decoy-state protocol where Alice randomly varies her pulse intensities between two values (signal and decoy states). This variation helps detect potential photon-number-splitting attacks in the quantum key distribution system. After generation, these states are processed through a simulated quantum channel that includes effects like loss before being detected by Bob's equipment.
